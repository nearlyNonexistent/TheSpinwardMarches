# Steward Khi Ulaar  
![KhiUlaar.png](../Attachments/KhiUlaar.png)  
  
I was once a prospector for Trexalon Technical Consortium. Now I manage guests aboard the IFT *Be Back By Dawn*, entertaining them with my modular synthesizer skills, stories of the mine, and my ability to cook a delightful resynthesized biscuits and gravy.
