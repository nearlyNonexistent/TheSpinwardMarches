# Asteltine 09.31

Fl Ni  
  
[Khloe Tanaka, TTC Exec](../Contacts/KhloeTanaka.md) runs a colony here, which the crew valiantly robbed, causing a hit to relations with Trexalon. [Khi Ulaar, Steward](../Crew/KhiUlaar.md) joined the crew here after assisting in the heist.  
  
Asteltine is a world dominated by [Sternmetal Horizons](SternmetalHorizons.md) and [Delgado](DelgadoTradingLIC.md), with a small [Trexalon Technical Consortium](TrexalonTechnicalConsortium.md) outpost here. The majority of jobs are related to the mining industry or servicing the miners, while the nobility and capitalists play dress up in holographic clothing. The air is acidic, and pollution regulations do not exist.
