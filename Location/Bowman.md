Homeworld of [Rrhyngir](../Crew/Rrhyngir.md). [Doctor Nikkolas Cell](../Contacts/NikkolasCell.md) has a laboratory here, where xenoarchaeological experiments are done. The IFT *Be Back By Dawn* was acquired from [Arthur Kinnear, Loan Shark](../Contacts/ArthurKinnear.md) here, as well, after repossessing it from its previous owner.  
  
Bowman is an asteroid belt controlled primarily by Ling Standard Protocols, though a struggling minority of independent belters eke out a living on the sides.
