Based on Mora, the merchant line Al Morai services the Spinward Marches, with routes to the Deneb and Trojan Reaches. In addition, Al Mora provides service to all worlds in the Mora Subsector, connecting them to the major trade routes.  
  
Al Morai was established in 75 as a local transport company serving systems within 10 parsecs of Mora, the company expanded by 120 to handle freight and passengers on a larger scale. During the third century Imperial, the line established an exploration division to supplement its cargo carriers.
