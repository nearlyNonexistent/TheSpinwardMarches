title: Ag Worlds Combine
---
  
Commercial alliance formed in 780 by the three agricultural worlds of District 268, Motmos, Tarkine and [Tarsus](Tarsus.md), for the purpose of regulating sales to the high population worlds of [Collace](../Location/Collace.md) and Forine. Despite initial difficulties, the three worlds were eventually able to establish a working relationship. The Combine would provide a steady supply of produce and the high-population worlds would provide a steady market at reasonable prices.  
  
The worlds of the Combine were threatened with takeover by Dallia in 840 but intervention by the two powerful consumer worlds kept the status quo intact
