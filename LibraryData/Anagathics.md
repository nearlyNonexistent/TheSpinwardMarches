# Anagathics  
  
Anagathics or Antiagathics are longevity drugs, usually a mixture of several compounds. They help prolong life and prevent aging in humans. A regimen of regular monthly doses enables an individual to ignore the debilitating effects of advancing years. They need to be used starting at the age of 30 and with luck the user may reach an age of 100 or more before old age starts to take its toll. Because of the rarity and demand for anagathics, they are quite expensive and are often unavailable at any price.  
  
It takes a while for the total effects of anagathics to be felt; it also take a while for the effects of anagathics to totally go away. However, there are withdrawal symptoms from interrupting the supply of the drug. Obviously, anagathics are most effective if they can be taken long-term without interruption. A continually-interrupted supply can have devastating effects. Anagathics have dangerous side-effects on some users and often anagathics users take extra risks to maintain a constant supply.  
  
Imperial society generally frowns on nobles who take anagathics.
