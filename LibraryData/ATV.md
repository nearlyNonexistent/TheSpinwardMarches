# ATV  
The All Terrain Vehicle is designed to provide high-quality transportation on any number of worlds. It can traverse all but the most forbidding terrain and is fully amphibious. The vehicle’s pressurised interior allows up to eight passengers living quarters with reasonable comfort for long periods of time, including laboratory, sleeping and galley arrangements. The ATV masses 10 tons and can carry a payload of six tons, including the driver and seven passengers. Cruising speed depends on the terrain being travelled: roads can allow up to 100 kph, while cross-country will rarely exceed 60 kph and broken ground will keep speeds to 20 kph and under. Tracked ATVs are somewhat slower than wheeled versions but are more reliable in difficult terrain.  
An ATV may be powered by a battery charged from a ship’s power plant, or it may contain a small fusion pack requiring hydrogen for fuel.  
The major drawbacks of ATVs are refuelling requirements (depending on the specific model), slowness in some types of terrain and the bulk of the vehicle itself. They are far too large to operate in built-up urban areas, for instance.
