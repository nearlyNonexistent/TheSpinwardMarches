# Dionyx Originatus  
The 'Ancients’ is a slang term for the race of intelligent, non-human beings who inhabited various locations in this portion of the galaxy approximately -300,000. The scientific name is *Dionyx Originatus*. Archaeological evidence recovered from excavations of the few known Ancient cities indicates that the race destroyed itself during a 2,000-year period of intense warfare, which left only ruined cities and shattered planets.  
  
The Ancients were responsible for several major features within the region now occupied by the Imperium. Their warfare resulted in the large proportion of asteroid belts throughout this spiral arm. Scattered empty cities (most severely damaged by battle) stand as evidence of their wars; most, however, are restricted areas under investigation by the Imperium and not open to the public. The Ancients are generally accepted as responsible for the dissemination of Humaniti within its current domain when they transplanted genetic stock from Terra to at least 40 worlds across a span of some 360 parsecs.  
  
See also Humaniti, [Solomani Hypothesis](SolomaniHypothesis.md).  
  
The Ancients were also responsible for the creation of the  
[Vargr](Vargr.md) through genetic manipulation of carnivore/chaser stock.  
Apparently, they used Terran canine stock acquired at the same  
time as humaniti.
