# Abyss Rift  
An area of space within the Lanth Subsector of the Spinward Marches.  
  
The Abyss has been the site of several notable ship disappearances over the last half-millennium and there has built up a substantial amount of lore associated with them.  
Curious jump-related phenomena have been reported in the rift for centuries, often by reliable witnesses. Scouts plying the [X-Boat](ExpressBoats.md) route report events such as receiving radio signals in jump-space to reports of ‘someone on the hull, trying to get in’.  
This is, of course, impossible.  
  
Only seven systems lie within the Abyss’ boundaries. The presence of three Red Zone worlds, [Victoria](Victoria.md), Ylavin and Sonthert, is taken as further evidence by locals that the rift is a bad place where strange and terrifying things happen.
