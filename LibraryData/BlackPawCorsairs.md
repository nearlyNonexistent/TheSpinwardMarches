# Black Paw Corsairs  
  
The Black Paw Corsairs are several interconnected pirate crews operating as a large [Vargr](Vargr.md) pack. They are currently led by Corsair Queen Aghirrg Rho, out of an unknown port. Their primary hunting grounds are within District 268 of the Spinward Marches.  
  
They are known for their constant flux in rules of engagement; survivors have reported being treated kindly, yet others have reported the rest of the crew being butchered in front of them.
