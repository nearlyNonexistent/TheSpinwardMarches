# Advanced Base  
  
Modular pressurized quarters with room for six persons. The system includes an air lock and an air recirculation system for life support. It takes about two hours to set up or take down a sealed section of the advanced base, and the interior can be set up or taken down in four hours in the relative comfort of the sealed base. The interior is also modular, allowing the interior layout to be altered to suit the needs of the guests.
