# Air/Raft  
  
Also known as a flier, the air/raft relies on solid-state anti-grav modules for lift and propulsion. Four independent, individually replaceable modules ensure maximum of safety, in that each provides one-quarter of the vehicleâ€™s total lift. A standard air/raft  
displaces about four tons and can carry a payload of about four tons, including the  
driver and three passengers. An air/raft can be overloaded with passengers (a maximum of eight can fit with minimal comfort) provided total tonnage capacity for the vehicle is not exceeded. Cruising speed is usually 100 kph and extremely subject to wind effects. Many of these designs are open-topped and subject to the effects of weather and climate. Enclosed air/rafts are also available for more hostile environments. Enclosed ones are often called "shuttles," despite not being shuttle-grade vessels. Air/rafts are also known as "flying cars".  
  
An air/raft can reach orbit (occupants must wear vacc suits) in several hours (number of  
hours equals planetary size digit in the UPP). Travel beyond low orbit is not possible, as the grav modules rapidly lose efficiency outside of a gravity well. The major drawbacks to the air/raft are its low load capacity, relatively slow speed and its susceptibility to weather (both the negative effects of bad weather on the passengers and the slowing effects of winds and buffeting).
