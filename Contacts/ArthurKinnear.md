# Arthur Kinnear, Loan Shark  
![ArthurKinnear.png](../Attachments/ArthurKinnear.png)  
  
Massive loan shark who made his money smuggling freight in-system on Bowman, and now bankrolls crime in the entire District. He's cosigned onto the Be Back By Dawn with the crew and Hortalez et Cie. He will enforce payments with bounty hunters, as he is liable for missed payments as well.  
  
A jackass grin with a TAS cap, he often travels by passenger liner to different worlds to check in with his various clients, making sure the money flows in and not checking where.  
  
He would be very useful for info about schemes for quick money: heists, kidnappings-for-ransom, low-grade piracy and raiding, and so on.
