# Syr Nova Bella, Star Priestess  
![500x500](../Attachments/NovaBella.png)  
  
A missionary from the Imperial border-world of Mertactor, Nova Bella came to the frontier to spread the word of the [Church of Stellar Divinity](ChurchStellarDivinity.md), to fight back the [Pavabid](Pavabid.md)ian heresy's spread. So far, she has found few who will sing the Starsong. She has however found a lover, in the form of [Talia Finlay](../Crew/TaliaFinlay.md).  
  
Her dark hair covers on eye, with the revealed side of her face having several starry tattoos that seem to map onto an old Astrogation map.    
    
She would know much about the Pavabidian heresy, and religious operations throughout the sector, and may one day come to Talia with a favor to ask. She also is a [Knight](Knight.md) by [frankalmoinage](Nobility.md#frankalmoinage), and has ties to the Imperial nobility.
