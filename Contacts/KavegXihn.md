# Kaveg Xihn, Zhodani Agent  
![KavegXihn.png](../Attachments/KavegXihn.png)  
  
A member of the Zhodani Operative Network, Kaveg Xihn often goes by fake names when travelling. They are supposedly psionic, but details remain scarce. He had a one night stand with [Rrhyngir](../Crew/Rrhyngir.md).  
  
With his floofable hair and glasses, and meek demeanor, he seems rather nonthreatening to most.    
  
He would be a great way to get more involved with the Zhodani Consulate, and discover information about psionic powers, but this might incur the wrath of the Third Imperium.
